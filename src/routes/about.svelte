<h1>About me</h1>

<p>Hello everyone,</p>

<p>My name is Younes and I am 20 years old 🤓.</p> 

<p>
	I have always been a huge fan of sharing knowledge through blogs, books, discussions, ... 
	But I have always thought that I was not that good at explaining things to people, so I have been trying to put that aside a little bit.
</p>

<p>
  Today, I realize that I have spent a big part of my life explaining concepts, programming languages, courses to people. 
  Especially during my school days. I was always standing explaining to my classmates rather than doing my exercises (which caused me some trouble sometimes 😂😭). 
  It was always a pleasure and I am very proud of myself for that.
</p>

<p>
  I mean that if it took me a few minutes per student, I would save them a lot of time (the time they would have spent finding information, 
  and maybe even finding the wrong solution or wrong explanation to a problem).
</p>

<p>
  That's why I finally decided to write articles and share them with as many people as possible. 
  And that's also why, I created this Instagram account, to be more accessible to people and reach more people maybe? We'll see 😁.
</p>

<p>
  I think that sharing information is essential, especially nowadays, and that's what the internet was all about in the beginning and still is today, 
  even though it is been going in all directions in the last few years (both for good and bad 😂).
</p>

<p>Finally, I will say that my English is not perfect at ALL, so be kind with me 😇</p>
