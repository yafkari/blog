# Younes Afkari - Personal Blog

In this repository I will build my personal blog with SvelteKit while learning it. 
(I already have some experience with Svelte but never used SvelteKit).

Good to mention that the articles are fetched from my profile on [DEV](https://dev.to/yafkari). At some point, I will probably host them myself, we'll see..
